# How Do This Work
The generator combines lower case, upper case letters and numbers, For more protection we also added an option to add characters in your passowrd 

# What's New?
As of 30/08/2020(5:57pm) i've **removed** the special characters because some website might not support it, I also add an option to add symbols as some website do not support it and some website forces you to add symbols to your password for better protection.

# How to Use?
Run the .exe file inside of the exe folder
You just need to type the length of your password and we will generate it for you
You can also use the complex mode which will make a more **secure** password
